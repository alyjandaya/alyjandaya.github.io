### What did I do this past week?
This past week I was mainly focused on finishing up Project 3, which my partner and I got in a couple days early, as well as wrapping up some interviews. I'm supposed to be hearing back from a couple companies this week, so looking forward to that. 

### What's in your way?
I have onsites coming up this week, so I'll definitely be missing class on Wednesday and possibly on Friday. I really do hate missing class, as that means a 0 for a quiz. I haven't been doing super hot on the quizzes, so the 0(s) is/are going to hurt! I, unfortunately, have some more Algo homework this week, so I really need to get started on that ASAP. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week I’ll be doing some more interviews and doing Algo hw. I am also hoping to get started on Project 4. I'm looking for a partner, so if you're looking to partner up, reply with your email!

This past week of class went well–I did ok on the quizzes. I think I more or less understood what was happening in class with weeks re: constructing our own vector. 

### Pick of the week
Apply everywhere. I think one of the mistakes I made early on in the year was not applying to a lot of places. I really wish I talked to more companies at the career fair and dropped more résumés. The worst thing that could happen is you get 0 offers – which is the same worst case as if you applied to 1 or 2 places. It’s still not to late, be sure to check out linkedin and indeed!
