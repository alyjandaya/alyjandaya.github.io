title: Week Two

### What did I do this past week?
This past week, like most others in the class, I started on Project 1. I started a little late in the week, but I'll explain why in the next section. I spent most of this week working on side projects and preparing for recruiting, as that's starting up for most people within the next couple of weeks.

### What's in your way?
I started the project only yesterday, and the reason I started so late is because I'm trying to study up for technical interviews and such. 

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I hope to start on the Project 2 a little earlier, but I also hope to ramp up my studying for technical interviews.

### Pick of the week
Besides going through Cracking the Coding Interview, I would also highly recommend www.interviewbit.com. It has tons of helpful exercises and problems!
