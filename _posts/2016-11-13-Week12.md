### What did I do this past week?
This past week was much more relaxed than last week. No exams and no projects due, so it was nice to relax a little. And I didn’t do as bad on my algorithms exam as I thought I had, which is nice. I got an early start on the Life program, so I’m hoping to finish that up by Tuesday. I had a paper due last Wednesday again, but that one wasn’t as bad as the one due last week. 

### What's in your way?
Currently, I don’t think I have much in my way. I have an exam and presentation this week, but there nothing too hard, so I’m not that worried about them. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week, like I mentioned before, I have an exam and presentation. So I’ll have to prep and study for both of those. I also need to finish up the Life Program. Going to also keep up my studying for other classes, so I’m not studying last minute for the 4 exams I have that last week of classes!

This past week of class went alright–I didn’t do too hot on the quizzes. I’m excited for lowest 6 to be dropped. Learning about inheritance in C++ has been pretty cool. Really enjoying the class right now. 


### Pick of the week
If you like R, I highly recommend checking Shiny. Shiny is a web application framework for R. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, jS or anything like that. So with just R and the Shiny framework, you can build some pretty cool web applications.
