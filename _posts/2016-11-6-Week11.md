### What did I do this past week?
This past week was quite insane. On Wednesday I had a 10-page paper due, and on Thursday Project 4 was due and I had an algorithms test. Luckily I was able to turn in everything on time, and the algorithms test went OK. It was a fair exam, but I already know some dumb mistakes I made. 

### What's in your way?
I’ve just not been doing as well on exams as I hoped I would be. I’d like to blame my intense focus on recruiting earlier this semester. Now that that is all over, I can spend more time studying for exams and reviewing notes to make sure I am always understanding what’s going on in class and not waiting till the hour before the exam. 

### What will you do next week?
This next week I have another paper due on Wednesday, and am currently in the process of completing some readings for that paper. I would also like to finish up project 5 (and am looking for a partner!) this week so I can focus on studying for exams that are coming up on the last week because I really need to do well on all of them. Like last week, I will be focusing more to make sure I can make a solid recovery from the first test. I am also hoping this extra credit and the dropped 5 quizzes help. 

This past week of class went better than usual–I did relatively well on the quizzes and I am getting the concepts. Now that I am better at paying attention in class and less distracted by outside worries, the class is much better and is making way mor sense. Magic how one's understanding increases when they just decide to focus, huh?

### Pick of the week
If you are interning in NYC this summer, check out some of these resources to find housing: https://www.nycintern.org/, http://www.nyu.edu/summer/housing/, http://www.newschool.edu/student-housing/summer/internships/ 

These are probably the best 3 I have found so far. If anybody has any other resources on this please send it over!
