### What did I do this past week?
Early this week, I have spent a lot of time studying for an Arabic Exam I had on Friday. I was also able to finish up some other side projects. My partner and I have been making great progress on the Netflix project, and we're getting a good RMSE. However, we're having some problems resolving some performance issues. Once we fix that, we'll be well on our way to submitting it. 

### What's in your way?
This upcoming week I want my focus to be on the career-fair and applying to summer internships. So the major obstacles that'll be in my way are: Arabic homework, algorithms homework, 200 pages of reading due for Wednesday, and a major essay due Wednesday. I'm hoping things will sort of ease up later in the week, allowing me to fill out more applications.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, like I mentioned before, I plan on really focusing on recruiting. I'll be spending a lot of time on LinkedIn and various company websites.

Class this week was great! I found class on Wednesday to be extremely valuable. It was awesome getting to learn about Bloomberg. I did well on the quizzes, so that was great as well.

### Pick of the week
DRESS WELL. You'll want to make sure when you go to career fair you look good, but professional as well. It's important to make sure you're looking fly, as it'll help with your confidence when talking to recruiters. If you don't like the way you look, it might not make you less confident, but it sure won't make you more confident. So, to be safe, dress well :)
