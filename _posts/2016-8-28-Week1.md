### What did I do this past week?

I have been told over and over again by UTCS graduates that you can't really say you did UTCS unless you've taken a class with Dr. Downing. Alas, here I am. This week has been a little scary, to say the least -- I'm taking 18 hours. So far, I've greatly enjoyed the OOP class, as I like the fact Dr. Downing takes the time to go through every single line of code in the example programs. In addition to OOP this past week, I also started the language portion for my History major. I'm taking Intensive Arabic 1, a 6 hour course. The amount of HW we have everyday is a tad bit insane, nevertheless, I'm quite excited for the intellectual challenge that learning one of the hardest languages in world will offer. Speaking of intellectual challenges, I also am taking CS 331 -- Algorithms & Complexity with Dr. Gal. She seems like a very cheerful and passionate professor. I'm excited to start exploring proofs again. Proofs, while something I was never amazingly talented at, are, more often than not, exciting problems. I am definitely very happy with my courses this semester. And now, going back to OOP, I have zero experience with C++, and my first exposure to C was with Dr. Gheith's 429 class this past summer. Regardless, I'm quite excited for OOP because of the various tools we're going to get to use, the fact I'll learn C++ thoroughly, and, of course, the fact I'll now be able to say I did UTCS the right way. 

### What's in your way?

Like I mentioned above, I have not used C++ before. I also have never used any of the developer tools Dr. Downing is having us use this semester. While these are currently "in my way", I'm excited to begin conquering them.

### What will you do next week?
